# Shell permissions
Linux systems are both multitasking and multiuser meaning more than one user can be operating the computer at the same time.

## File permissions
On a Linux system, each file and directory is assigned access rights for the owner of the file, the members of a group of related users, and everybody else

## Permission settings
* rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111
* rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110
* rwx --- --- = 111 000 000

*and so on...*

* rwx = 111 in binary = 7
* rw- = 110 in binary = 6
* r-x = 101 in binary = 5
* r-- = 100 in binary = 4

## Common commands
Some of the common commands used include:

1. chmod - modify file access rights
2. su - temporarily become the superuser
3. sudo - temporarily become the superuser
4. chown - change file ownership
5. chgrp - change a file's group ownership
